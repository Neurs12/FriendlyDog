<p align=center>A simple plugin to add features for tamed wolves.</p>

It's annoying while playing SMP. You accidentally hit, slash, someone with tamed wolves, sometimes that action will kill the beloved pet. And nobody wants to lose their helpful companion like that.
So I've created this plugin to make both the players and the tamed wolves can't fight each other.

## Features
- Tamed wolves won't attack other players for any reason.
- Players can't attack tamed wolves.
- When the owner's offline, it will become invincible.

## Enable / Disable
- The plugin will always be in activated mode.
- To disable or enable it, just run the command "/fd" with no extra arguments, think of it like a switch, and of course, only someone with OP permission can run this command.
